	 * A class definition consists of a signature and a body. The class signature
	 * defines the name of the class and may also specify other important
	 * information. The body of a class is a set of members enclosed in curly
	 * braces. The members of a class usually include fields and methods, and may
	 * also include constructors, initializers, and nested types.

	 * Nested classes are divided into two categories: non-static and static. Non-static
	 * nested classes are called inner classes. Nested classes that are declared static
	 * are called static nested classes.
	 * 
	 * A nested class is a member of its enclosing class. Non-static nested classes
	 * (inner classes) have access to other members of the enclosing class, even if
	 * they are declared private. Static nested classes do not have access to other
	 * members of the enclosing class. As a member of the OuterClass, a nested class
	 * can be declared private, public, protected, or package private.
